During evaluations, a panel of listeners raved about The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker’s “perfect” amount of bass, “crisp” transmission of speech, and its full tones in musical genres ranging from easy listening to hip-hop, all produced by its two speakers. While distortion garbled the output of lesser units, The Best Portable Bluetooth Speaker’s passive radiators and custom transducers helped prevent muddled audio. Panelists also deemed The Best unit easy to use, pairing quickly with Bluetooth-enabled devices and remembering up to eight devices.

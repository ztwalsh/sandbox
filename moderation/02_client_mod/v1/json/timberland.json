         "review_comments":"This is actually a late review, I bought my first pair of these boots around the same time last year. I figured out after a year of wearing them, I can now give a proper review :)<br /><br />So, to start, I decided on getting the men's instead of the women's because my feet are wider than most women's and men's shoes usually fit me nicely. I also ended up having 2 pairs of these boots. At the beginning, I heard that these boots run big, so I went down half a size. For men's size, I normally wear 10.5 (for running shoes etc). It was all good then because it was winter, and the thick socks I wore fits nicely in them, and in order to keep the snow and wind out, they are always laced up properly. One of the things I love about these boots is that they managed to keep my feet completely dry even when I walk through the thick snow, and they also managed to keep my feet warm throughout the winter with just a pair of thick socks. One thing to note, though, is that they are especially prone to water stain and scratch easily, but I like them rugged, so I don't mind that.<br /><br />All was good till the weather started getting warmer and I have to trade my thick socks for something much thinner. The looser fit isn't that apparent if I keep my laces properly tied up like I did all winter, but once I started wearing them loose, it just won't stay on properly anymore. Since I am a lazy person, and I really wanted to enjoy these boots properly together with the joy of throwing them on in seconds and kicking them off as I like, I bought a second pair, size 9.5. The second pair fits me nicely like a pair of running shoes would. I have also worn these boots in summer and it still remains comfortable.",

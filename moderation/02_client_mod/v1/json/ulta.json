         "review_comments":"Preface this review: I love all of the Laura Geller products I have tried. Even the ones that were in shades that just didn't work for me, I still try to use because there is always something so nice about them, I just don't want to part with them. Best example, the lip gloss from the Strawberry Swirl set doesn't suit my coloring at all, but it feels so nice to wear, I will wear it around the house.<br /><br />I bought this Best of Baked palette to give as a gift, but I will be returning it. When I viewed it on display in store after blindly purchasing it online, I could plainly see that half the space of this palette is empty bulk. If the packaging were more attractive, that might have been ok, but it is pretty plain.",

         "review_comments":"I have been a loyal CHI owner for 15 years. This is the first CHI flat iron that has disappointed me. After only using this for two months, the flat iron won't turn on. When I do get it to turn on, it shuts off randomly. For the two months that it worked, it was wonderful. It heated up in less than 1 minute and stayed hot for the 20 minutes it would take to straighten/style my thick, shoulder-length wavy hair. Maybe I got a dud; my classic CHI iron lasted more than 5 years before it died, so I am guessing there is an egregious design flaw in this one that I can't put my finger on. If you choose to buy this product, know that there is a risk of it dying after a very short period of time.",

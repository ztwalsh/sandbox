Our last Whirlpool set lasted for over twenty years and is still going in a young couple's home. So it was an easy choice getting the new Whirlpool with updated options.",

Very easy to set up and get ready to use. the full stove top grate is fantastic for being able to move things off of the heat and not have to worry about trying to locate a hot pad or someplace else to set things. Also having the 5 burners is a huge benefit. The oven size is great and have had it completely full already on New Years with a house full of people. Only thing i feel is missing is a griddle to place over the top but other than that - fantastic!!!",
